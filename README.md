## Install

Install requirements (ideally in a virtual environment):

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start in 2 Minutes
To get started we simply need to create a workspace in [Airfold](https://airfold.co) and retrieve an API key.
It's 100% free and takes less than a minute.


We use Airfold because it makes it so much easier to build real-time applications.


1. Go to [Airfold app](https://app.airfold.co/) and create a new workspace.

2. Press on the "Admin" token on the sidebar and copy it.
The token should look like this: `aft_6eab...KQvCddV`.

1. Then simply run `af config` in the project folder and paste the token:

```shell
$ af config
Configuring for API URL: https://api.airfold.co
? Api key: aft_6eab8...ocvKQddV

ðŸš€ config successfully set up!
You can manually modify it in: '/home/user/airlang/.airfold/config.yaml'
```

4. Push the project to your Airfold workspace:
```shell
af push ./airfold
```

5. Add the pricing data to calculate costs:
```shell
af source append prices airfold/sources/prices.csv
```

Feel free to navigate to the UI and see all the sources and pipes you've pushed:

## Let's ingest 1000 rows.

Run the script `main.py`
You will need to set API keys: `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `AIRFOLD_API_KEY`

```shell
$ OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxx \
AIRFOLD_API_KEY=aft_6eab8f...QddV \
python main.py
```

## Let's run the Streamlit dashboard

```shell
AIRFOLD_API_KEY=aft_6eab8f...ddV \
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
